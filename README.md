<h1 align="center">Hand Gesture Recognition System</h1>
This project presents a real-time Sign Language Detection System using computer vision and deep learning techniques. The system captures and interprets sign language gestures through a webcam, providing a versatile tool for enhancing communication accessibility.

## Key Features
* **Real-time Gesture Recognition:** The system detects and classifies sign language gestures in real-time, offering immediate feedback.

* **Holistic Landmark Detection:** Utilizing the MediaPipe library, the system captures facial, hand, and pose landmarks to understand the intricate details of sign language expressions.

* **LSTM Neural Network:** A trained LSTM neural network processes the captured keypoints, enabling accurate classification of sign language gestures.

## Requirements
* Operating System: Requires a 64-bit OS (Windows 10 or Ubuntu) for compatibility with deep learning frameworks.
* Development Environment: Python 3.6 or later is necessary for coding the sign language detection system.
* Deep Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow for model training, MediaPipe for hand gesture recognition.
* Image Processing Libraries: OpenCV is essential for efficient image processing and real-time hand gesture recognition.
* Version Control: Implementation of Git for collaborative development and effective code management.
* IDE: Use of VSCode as the Integrated Development Environment for coding, debugging, and version control integration.
* Additional Dependencies: Includes scikit-learn, TensorFlow (versions 2.4.1), TensorFlow GPU, OpenCV, and Mediapipe for deep learning tasks.
